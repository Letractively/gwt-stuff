#summary GWT-Stuff Property Change Source interfaces

= Introduction =

This module provides interfaces that mark objects as sources for 
[http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyChangeEvent.html
java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent]s. This is needed because GWT does not support reflection
and there is no standard way to indicate that an object is the source of property change
events.

= Dependencies =

Since GWT does not yet support the java.beans.PropertyChangeSupport and related classes
you will need to include the [http://code.google.com/p/gwtx/ GWTx] module in your project
also to enable you to use these classes in your GWT Project.

= Inherits =

<inherits name="org.mcarthur.sandy.gwt.event.property.PropertyChange"/> :
    This inherits the Property Change module for use in your project.
