= Introduction =

Hopefully we've made using GWT-Stuff is easy as possible.

== Download ==

First you will need to [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-stuff/downloads/list download] the
module(s) you want to use. For simplicity in this GettingStarted guide we'll assume you
downloaded the GWT-Stuff-`YYYYMMDD`.jar that contains everything from GWT-Stuff.

== Including GWT-Stuff in your GWT Project ==

=== Updating Claspath ===
Once you've downloaded the needed jar(s) you need to add them to the classpath for your
project.

=== GWT Module Imports ===

See the various modules pages for how to import them into your GWT Module.
