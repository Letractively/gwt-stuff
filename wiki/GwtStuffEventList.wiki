#summary GWT-Stuff EventList

= Introduction =

Those familiar with [http://publicobject.com/glazedlists/ Glazed Lists] will be familiar
with the ideas behind GWT-Stuff's EventList module. EventList provides a java.util.List
implementation that fires events when the list is modified. This is very useful for
keeping your model and view separate and allowing the view to automatically update when
the model changes.
