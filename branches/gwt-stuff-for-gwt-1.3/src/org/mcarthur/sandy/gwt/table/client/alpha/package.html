    ALPHA CODE: do not use.
    This is where I'm testing and working on a new table Widget built on top of ObjectListTable.
    Once it works, it will be refactored into another package.
</p>
<p>
    The goal is a table similar to the tables used on
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/list">Google Code for issues</a>.
    Built in support for the following will be included:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>User editable column layout (probably make this optionial too)</li>
    <li>column sorting (optionial)</li>
    <li>column filtering (optionial)</li>
    <li>column pagination (optionial)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The programmer will be expected to provide a description of the table model.
    Table features will be enabled based on what interfaces the programmer chooses to implement.
